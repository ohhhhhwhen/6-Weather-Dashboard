## Assignment info
This application assignment was a Weather Dashboard.
An html that displays the current weather of a desired
location. Depending on what the user searches. Using an
online weather api, I was able to grab various info about
locations using Asynchronous Javascript (ajax). With that I
was able to grab and display the temperature, humidity, 
wind speed, and uv. In addition, the html includes a small
display of the next 5 days in the searched location. With 
basic temperature information.
